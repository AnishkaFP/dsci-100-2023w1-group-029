    "The topic aims to show the presence of heart disease in individuals, depending on various factors. The study specifically focuses on the Thalassemia heart disease, which is a blood disorder that causes your body to have too little hemoglobin, which is what enables red blood cells to carry oxygen."

    "Our project will seek to predict heart disease in patients based on their performance in a series of easily accessible metrics with the intent of identifying patients that are likely to be affected early for further testing. "
